#vEwe - A Javascript Event Manager

vEwe is a JS library used to manage events in an easy to extend object. With jQuery as its sole dependency it provides a lightweight alternative for those wishing to avoid a full fledged "framework".

**Key features include:**
+ AMD (asynchronous module definition) ready
+ Unlimited inheritance in 2 flavors
+ Light weight prototypical view objects
+ Events with all the power of jQuery's .on()
